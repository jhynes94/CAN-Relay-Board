# CAN-Relay-Board
CAN controlled Relay board for automotive applications

## Items to complete
1. Detemine Relay to use for design (based on Current(A)/Costs constraints).
2. Design better interface board to use Arduino Nano Programmer
    1. JST Connector to Arduino Development Board
    2. 2.54mm Connector with standard interface board
    3. Consider adding UART connector as well.
3. Determine modes needed for device
    1. CAN ID changing?
    2. CAN Mode changing?
    3. How this should be modified? (DIP swich or via SW)

## Development Setup

Programming the ATTiny is a bit difficult. Setup can be completed using the following tutorial:
